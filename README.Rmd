## About

The goal of rabinoffmmmr is to provide an interface for building and employing media mix models that resembles building and employing standard statistical and machine learning models. Model parameters will be stored in an initial model spec object of class `mmmr`, which then can be used with `fit`, `predict`, and `coef`. 

A media mix model aim to attribute relative success or failure to advertising efforts based on the relative success or failure of the business on or around the time the advertising effort is being employed. In concrete terms, if a business had $100,000 in sales in a given week, and it advetised on TV, Radio, and Social Media, a media mix model will attempt to determine what amount of those sales were attributable to TV, what amount to Radio, and what amount to Social Media.

There are different strategies for constructing a media mix model. The ones employed here closes follow those in Meta's open source [Robyn](https://facebookexperimental.github.io/Robyn/) project, though choices of backend and interface are different. Most notably, this package does not require any python-based backends, and thus does not require `reticulate`. 

## Strategy

With this package, each media channel can be evaluated for success along three parameters:

- Raw effectiveness
- Rate of diminishing/growing returns (saturation)
- Staying power over time (adstocking)

The model will decide these by optimizing each channel with the following parameters:

- Coefficient: The scale at which an advertising channel translates to results (e.g. ad spend -> sales)
- Gamma:       How quickly an advertising channel reaches diminishin returns with more spend (low gamma = quick diminishing returns)
- Alpha:       How quickly an advertising channel reaches growing returns with more spend (low alpha = returns start out high. High alpha = returns start low, but build up to a certain point).
- Theta:       How long an ad stays effective over time (high theta = more staying power).

The model will decide these values for each relevant advertising channel, subject to user tweaking. See below for examples.

To capture seasonality and trend effects, we use Meta's [Prophet](https://facebook.github.io/prophet/) package.

## Installation

You can install the development version of rabinoffmmmr like so:

``` r
## NOT RUN
#devtools::install_github("DerksenRabinoff/rabinoffmmmr")
```

## Example

Attaching rabinoffmmmr. Sample training data will be loaded called `historical_ad_spends`. Sample data to predict on will be loaded called `spend_plan`.

```{r setup, eval = FALSE}
library(rabinoffmmmr)
```
 
The mmm needs to know the dependent variable, the date variable, and which channels need diminishing returns and adstocking calculated.

### Model Setup

```{r set up variables}
## The data has the following columns
dependent <- "Sales"
date <- "Week Starting"

## Let's suppose the following are subject to diminishing returns effects
saturation_vars <- c("TV Spend", "Radio Spend", "Online Video Spend", "Social Media Spend")

## Let's suppose the following are subject to adstocking effects (retention in consumer memory)
adstocking_vars <- c("TV Spend", "Radio Spend", "Social Media Spend", "Search Ads Spend", "Direct Mail Spend")

## The predictors will include all variables other than the date and dependent variable
predictor_vars <- setdiff(names(historical_ad_spends), c(dependent, date))

## Make sure the date variable is of type "Date" and that every row has a date
historical_ad_spends[[date]] <- lubridate::as_date(historical_ad_spends[[date]])
historical_ad_spends %<>% dplyr::filter(!is.na(`Week Starting`))
head(historical_ad_spends) %>% knitr::kable()
```
 
Set up an mmmr model
```{r model}
## Use the variables above to make an mmmr model. The remainder of the variables will use default values
model <- mmmr(predictors = predictor_vars, saturated = saturation_vars, adstocked = adstocking_vars, dep_col = dependent, date_col = date)
```
 
### Model Training And Results
 
Train the model
```{r training, cache = TRUE}
start_time <- Sys.time()
model_fit <- fit.mmmr(object = model, data = historical_ad_spends, silent = TRUE, maxiter = 1)
print(Sys.time() - start_time)
``` 

Parameters and coefficients of the model:
```{r results}
## "complete" means include coefs that are 0. "params" means include the alpha, gamma, and theta parameters of the fit.
model_results <- coef(model_fit, complete=TRUE, params = TRUE)
model_results %>% knitr::kable()
```

Predictions from the model. If adstocking is high (high thetas) consider cutting the first few rows. Adstocking values depend on previous rows.
```{r predict}
## Load new data

spend_plan[[date]] <- lubridate::as_date(spend_plan[[date]], format = "%B %d, %Y")
spend_plan %<>% dplyr::filter(!is.na(`Week Starting`))

predictions <- predict.mmmr_fit(model_fit, spend_plan)

print(predictions)
```

You can include the full modified data with the predict method as well. This may be useful if you want to see the return for individual columns. In this table, each column represents the weekly contribution of that predictor to sales.
```r
predictions_tbl <- predict.mmmr_fit(model_fit, full_table = TRUE)
head(predictions_tbl) %>% knitr::kable()
```

### Visualizations

There are two functions, `plot_diminishing_returns` and `plot_adstocking` that can visualize the return on individual ad channels. `plot_diminishing_returns` presents the return of a channel as exposure varies, and `plot_adstocking` presents how the exposure degrades over time. If you use the parameter `rate=TRUE` on `plot_diminishing_returns`, the y axis shows the return on the next dollar spent as opposed to the total return at a given exposure level. Both functions return a `ggplot2::ggplot` object, and thus are subject to any additional formatting as any `ggplot` object.

```r
dim_returns_plot <- plot_diminishing_returns(model_fit, "TV Spend")
dim_returns_rate_plot <- plot_diminishing_returns(model_fit, "TV Spend", rate=TRUE)
adstock_plot <- plot_adstocking(model_fit, "TV Spend")
dim_returns_plot
```
![Diminishing returns plot](./man/figures/dim_return_plot.png)
![Diminishing returns rate plot](./man/figures/dim_return_rate_plot.png)
![Adstocking plot](./man/figures/adstock_plot.png)

We can clean it up a little by adding formatting. The ellipses in `plot_diminishing_returns` add arguments to the function generating the inflection point.

```r
dim_returns_plot <- plot_diminishing_returns(model_fit, "Social Media Spend", hjust = 0, size = 4, rate = TRUE) + tidyquant::theme_tq()
dim_returns_plot
```
![Pretty diminishing returns plot](./man/figures/dim_returns_pretty.png)


We can summarize the results in a faceted plot.

```r
dim_returns_facet <- plot_diminishing_returns_facet(model_fit, rate = TRUE, ncol = 2, vjust = .5, hjust = 0) + tidyquant::theme_tq()
adstock_facet <- plot_adstocking_facet(model_fit) + tidyquant::theme_tq()
dim_returns_facet
adstock_facet
```
